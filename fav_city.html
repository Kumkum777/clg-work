    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favorite city is <b>Lucknow</b>, also called the
      <b>“City of Nawabs”</b>. It is a place full of history, culture, and
      kindness. There are many beautiful monuments like Bara Imambara, Rumi
      Darwaza, and Chota Imambara that remind us of its royal past. <br />

      The city is also famous for its delicious food like

        >kebabs and biryani, and its beautiful chikankariembroidery</big
      >. People in Lucknow are very polite and friendly. From the busymarkets of
      Hazratganj to the peaceful evenings near the Gomti River,Lucknow always
      feels special and close to my heart.
